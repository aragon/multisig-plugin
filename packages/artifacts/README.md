# Multisig Plugin artifacts

This package contains the ABI of the Multisig Plugin for OSx, as well as the address of its plugin repository on each supported network. Install it with:

```sh
yarn add @aragon/multisig-plugin-artifacts
```

## Usage

```typescript
// ABI definitions
import {
    MultisigABI,
    IMultisigABI,
    ListedCheckConditionABI,
    MultisigSetupABI
} from "@aragon/multisig-plugin-artifacts";

// Plugin Repository addresses per-network
import { addresses } from "@aragon/multisig-plugin-artifacts";
```

You can also open [addresses.json](https://github.com/aragon/multisig-plugin/blob/main/packages/artifacts/src/addresses.json) directly.
