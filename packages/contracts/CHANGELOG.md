### Changed

- Bumped OpenZepplin to `4.9.6`.
- Used `ProxyLib` from `osx-commons-contracts` for the UUPS proxy deployment in `MultisigSetup`.
- Hard-coded the `bytes32 internal constant EXECUTE_PERMISSION_ID` constant in `MultisigSetup` until it is available in `PermissionLib`.
- Changed the `prepareInstallation` function in `MultisigSetup` to not unnecessarily grant the `UPGRADE_PLUGIN_PERMISSION_ID` permission to the installing DAO.
- Changed the `prepareUpdate` function in `MultisigSetup` to revoke the previously unnecessarily granted `UPGRADE_PLUGIN_PERMISSION_ID` permission from the installing DAO.
