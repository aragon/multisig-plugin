= Multisig plugin

IMPORTANT: The contracts are currently being audited, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.


== Description

**Multisig** is a governance plugin developed and maintained by the Aragon core team. Unlike traditional multisig solutions that rely on off-chain aggregation of signatures, this plugin offers a fully on-chain approval mechanism. It allows users to create proposals that require a configurable subset of approvals (e.g., **x** out of **y**) from a list of approvers. Each approver can individually cast their approval directly on-chain.

Once a proposal meets the required threshold of approvals, the list of proposed actions can be passed to the associated DAO or executor for execution.



== Proposal Lifecycle

=== **Creation**:

Proposals can be created by users who have the `CREATE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION` or those verified through the `ListedCheckCondition`, depending on the plugin’s configuration and how the permission is granted. The creation process includes:

** Taking a snapshot block (`block.number - 1`) at the time of creation to ensure consistent eligibility for approvers.
** Instantiating a proposal and recording proposal metadata, a list of actions, start and end dates, and approval thresholds based on the snapshot block.
** Optionally, the proposal creator can immediately cast their approval during the creation process.

[NOTE]
====
**Proposal creation settings**:
- onlyListed: Whether only listed addresses can create a proposal or not.
====

=== **Approval**:

Approvers listed in the address list can cast their approval individually. The process includes:

** Verifying that the proposal is open, the approver is eligible based on the snapshot taken at creation, and the approver hasn’t already approved.
** Ensuring the proposal has not expired; proposals are considered expired and ineligible for further approval once their end date has passed.
** Updating the count of approvals and marking the approver as having approved.
** Optionally, the approver can pass `true` for `tryExecution` along with their approval. This prompts the plugin to attempt execution if the proposal meets the necessary conditions.

=== **Execution**:

Once the proposal meets the required number of approvals:

** The `execute` function can be called by users with the `EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION`.
[NOTE]
====
Typically, this permission is set to any address, allowing anyone to execute, but it can also be restricted to specific users or conditions if needed.
====

** The plugin verifies that the proposal is open, the approval threshold has been met, and then executes the listed actions by passing them to the associated DAO or executor.
** After execution, the proposal is marked as executed, preventing further approvals or execution attempts.

[NOTE]
====
**Proposal execution settings**:
- minApprovals: The minimal number of approvals required for a proposal to pass.
====

== Plugin Settings

The **Multisig** plugin provides three key configuration functions to manage governance settings and approvers. All three functions require the `UPDATE_MULTISIG_SETTINGS_PERMISSION`, which is typically granted to the associated DAO.

=== 1. Update Multisig Settings

Modifies the plugin’s configuration, which includes: **`onlyListed` and `minApprovals`**.

* **Constraints**:
  - `minApprovals` must be at least 1 and no greater than the current number of approvers.

* **Impact**:
  - Changes apply to all proposals created after the settings are updated.

=== 2. Add Addresses

Adds new addresses to the list of approvers, enabling them to participate in the proposal approval process.

* **Constraints**:
  - The total number of addresses cannot exceed `2^16 - 1` (to ensure compatibility with `uint16`, the maximal number of approvals).

* **Impact**:
  - Newly added addresses can approve proposals created after their addition.
  - Reduces the relative weight of approvals required, as the minimum approval threshold remains the same while the total number of approvers increases.

=== 3. Remove Addresses

Removes existing addresses from the list of approvers, restricting their ability to approve proposals.

* **Constraints**:
  - After removal, the number of remaining addresses must not be less than the current minimum approvals threshold (`minApprovals`).

* **Impact**:
  - Removed addresses lose their approval rights for all proposals created after their removal.
  - Increases the relative weight of approvals required, as the minimum approval threshold remains the same while the total number of approvers decreases.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since each function contains its own independent logic checks, if it is necessary to reduce the number of approvers to below the current `minApproval` threshold, the proposal for making this change should include at least two actions in the following exact order:

1. Update the multisig settings to lower the `minApproval` value.
2. Remove the addresses from the approvers list.

This ensures that the operation is valid and does not violate the plugin’s constraints.

== Plugin Setup

* **Contracts**: The **MultisigSetup** contains the **Multisig** plugin’s implementation and automatically deploys and prepares the following contracts:
** **Multisig Proxy**: The ERC1967Proxy contract pointing to the Multisig plugin’s implementation.
** **ListedCheckCondition**: A condition contract used to determine whether a user meets the eligibility criteria for creating proposals. It enforces the `onlyListed` setting from the Multisig plugin, ensuring that only listed members can propose actions if the setting is enabled.

* **Permissions**: The **MultisigSetup** establishes the following default permissions to ensure smooth operation and integration with the associated DAO:

[cols="2,2,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Permission ID | Where (Granted By) | Who (Granted To) | Condition | Functions

| EXECUTE_PERMISSION_ID
| DAO
| Plugin
| None
| execute

| UPDATE_MULTISIG_SETTINGS_PERMISSION_ID
| Plugin
| DAO
| None
| addAddresses, removeAddresses, updateMultisigSettings

| CREATE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID
| Plugin
| Any Address
| ListedCheckCondition
| createProposal

| SET_TARGET_CONFIG_PERMISSION_ID
| Plugin

| None
| setTargetConfig

| SET_METADATA_PERMISSION_ID
| Plugin
| DAO
| None
| setMetadata

| EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID
| Plugin
| Any Address
| None
| execute
|===

This setup ensures that the **Multisig** plugin is ready for operation immediately after installation, with all required contracts deployed and permissions configured.
